# TermIt Docker

TermIt Docker serves to spin off a TermIt deployment, consisting of:

- [GraphDB](https://www.ontotext.com/products/graphdb/) (database)
- [TermIt](https://github.com/kbss-cvut/termit) (backend)
- [Annotace](https://github.com/kbss-cvut/annotace)
- [TermIt UI](https://github.com/kbss-cvut/termit-ui) (frontend)

## Prerequisities

- Docker 19.03.0 or later & Docker Compose installed (and accessible under the current user).

### Resource Requirements

- TermIt: at least 512MB RAM (1GB and more is optimal), at least 2 CPUs
    - In case more users create and edit terms in TermIt, more CPUs is recommended
- TermIt UI: 100MB RAM
- GraphDB: at least 2GB RAM (depending on the amount of data stored), 1 CPU
- Annotace: at least 512MB RAM

Ideally, the whole deployment should have at least 4GB RAM available, with at least 2-3 CPU cores.

## Running TermIt

1. Set email server configuration in `.env`. In particular, set `MAIL_HOST`, `MAIL_USERNAME` and `MAIL_PASSWORD`,
   (optionally) `MAIL_PORT`.
2. (_Optional_) Set `ROOT` variable in `.env` to reflect the local context prefix the app will be running on.
3. (_Optional_) Set `HOST_PORT` variable in `.env` to reflect the port on which TermIt should be accessible.
4. (_Optional_) Set `URL` variable in `.env` to reflect the address TermIt will be running on. If the system is running
   behind a server proxy (like Apache), the URL should be the **public URL** provided by the server proxy (for
   example, https://termit.fel.cvut.cz). Otherwise,
   the URL should contain the `HOST_PORT` specified above (for example, http://localhost:1234). If the **public URL**
   is not based on standards HTTP(S) ports (80, 443), set also the `PUBLIC_PORT` so that the backend is able to
   correctly generate server URL for the API docs using Swagger UI.
5. (_Optional_, recommended) Set `JWT_SECRET_KEY` variable in `.env`. It should be a string of at least 32 characters
   that will be used to hash the JWT authentication token for logged-in users.
6. Start all the services by running
   `docker-compose up -d`
7. (_Optional_) If you have a license for GraphDB, go to `${URL}/${ROOT}/sluzby/db-server/license/register` and upload
   the license file.
8. Go to `${URL}/${ROOT}/sluzby/db-server/sparql` and execute all the queries in the `db-server/lucene` directory to
   create Lucene connectors for full-text search (see below w.r.t. the connector language settings).
9. Look for admin credentials in the `termit-server` log (on Linux/WSL, you can use
   grep: `docker-compose logs | grep "Admin credentials"`) and use them for first login at the configured URL,
   e.g., http://localhost:1234/termit.

### Security Note

Note that the default setup shown above does not protect access to the GraphDB repository. If TermIt as a whole is
exposed (e.g., via a reverse proxy), anyone could access and edit data in GraphDB. To fix this, go to the GraphDB
workbench (at `${URL}/${ROOT}/sluzby/db-server`), go to "Setup" -> "Users and Access", create an admin user and enable
security. Then create another user for TermIt and give it write access to the `termit` repository. Use the TermIt user's
credentials as values for `GDB_USERNAME` and `GDB_PASSWORD` in `.env` and restart all services.

## Configuration

TermIt is highly configurable both in terms of the content and the way it runs. This section provides details on
the most important configuration options.

### Language

The default configuration assumes TermIt is run for Czech vocabularies. To use TermIt in other environments, the
following changes are needed:

#### TermIt

TermIt backend stores and loads strings based on the configured language. To change it, set
the `TERMIT_PERSISTENCE_LANGUAGE` value in `docker-compose.yml` to the appropriate language tag (e.g., en, de).

#### Full Text Search

Full text search (FTS) is implemented via Lucene connectors in the underlying GraphDB repository. These connectors are
language-specific, so to use a different language for TermIt and FTS working correctly, the Lucene connectors need to be
configured accordingly. To use a different language that Czech, set the following in the connector-creating SPARQL
queries in `db-server/lucene`:

- Set the value of the "languages" attribute to the appropriate language tag
- Set the value of the "analyzer" attribute to the appropriate fully qualified Lucene analyzer class name. See, for
  example, https://lucene.apache.org/core/4_0_0/analyzers-common/overview-summary.html.

### Further TermIt Configuration

As stated above, TermIt is highly configurable. The following table lists the names of environment variables that can be
passed to TermIt backend either directly in `docker-compose.yml`, in
an [env_file](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v3/#env_file), or via command line.

**\* Required**

The parameters are based on
the [Configuration](https://github.com/kbss-cvut/termit/blob/master/src/main/java/cz/cvut/kbss/termit/util/Configuration.java)
class in TermIt backend. If you need to further adjust the behavior of TermIt, consult this class.

### Host Proxy Configuration

TermIt uses Web sockets for asynchronous communication between the server and the clients. If the host system runs a web
proxy (most do),
this needs to be configured in the proxy.

#### Apache2

For the Apache HTTP server (default on Debian and other Linux systems) this can be done by enabling the
`mod_proxy_wstunnel` [module](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_proxy_wstunnel.html) and using the following
rewrite rule:

```apache2
# Proxy WebSocket connections to termit at port 1234
  RewriteCond %{HTTP:Upgrade} websocket [NC]
  RewriteCond %{HTTP:Connection} upgrade [NC]
  RewriteRule ^/termit?(.*) "ws://localhost:1234/termit/sluzby/server$1" [P,L]
```

#### Nginx

For nginx, this can be done by adding the following snippet, which initializes the `connection_upgrade` variable, to
the `http` section of the `nginx.conf` file:

```nginx
map $http_upgrade $connection_upgrade {
   default upgrade;
   ''      close;
}
```

And then adding the `Upgrade` and `Connection` headers to the request:

```nginx
location /termit {
   proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
   proxy_set_header Connection $connection_upgrade;
   # Other proxy headers and proxy_pass
}
```
