# TermIt Docker

TermIt Docker serves to spin off a TermIt deployment, consisting of:

- [GraphDB](https://www.ontotext.com/products/graphdb/) (database)
- [TermIt](https://github.com/kbss-cvut/termit) (backend)
- [Annotace](https://github.com/kbss-cvut/annotace)
- [Validation service](https://github.com/kbss-cvut/validation-service/)
- [TermIt UI](https://github.com/kbss-cvut/termit-ui) (frontend)
- [OntoGrapher](https://github.com/datagov-cz/ontoGrapher/tree/standalone) (standalone branch)
- [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/)

## Prerequisites

- Docker 23.0.1 or later & Docker Compose installed (and accessible under the current user).

### Resource Requirements

- TermIt: at least 512MB RAM (1GB and more is optimal), at least 2 CPUs
    - In case more users create and edit terms in TermIt, more CPUs are recommended
- TermIt UI: 100MB RAM
- GraphDB: at least 2GB RAM (depending on the amount of data stored), 1 CPU
- Annotace: at least 512MB RAM
- Validation service: at least 1GB RAM (depending on the size of the vocabulary)
- OntoGrapher: same as TermIt UI
- Keycloak + Postgres: (1CPU and approx. 512MB RAM)

Ideally, the whole deployment should have at least 4GB RAM available, with at least 2â€“3 CPU cores.

## Running TermIt

1. Set email server configuration in `.env`. In particular, set `MAIL_HOST`, `MAIL_USERNAME` and `MAIL_PASSWORD`,
   (optionally) `MAIL_PORT`.
2. (_Optional_) Set `ROOT` variable in `.env` to reflect the local context prefix the app will be running on.
3. (_Optional_) Set `HOST_PORT` variable in `.env` to reflect the port on which TermIt should be accessible.
4. (_Optional_) Set `URL` variable in `.env` to reflect the address TermIt will be running on. If the system is running
   behind a server proxy (like Apache), the URL should be the **public URL** provided by the server proxy (for
   example, https://termit.fel.cvut.cz). Otherwise,
   the URL should contain the `HOST_PORT` specified above (for example, http://localhost:1234). If the **public URL**
   is not based on standards HTTP(S) ports (80, 443), set also the `PUBLIC_PORT` so that the backend is able to
   correctly generate server URL for the API docs using Swagger UI.
5. (_Optional_) Set `KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_USER` and `KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_PASSWORD` in `.env` to a custom value.
6. Start all the services by running
   `docker-compose up -d`
7. (_Optional_) If you have a license for GraphDB, go to `${URL}/${ROOT}/sluzby/db-server/license/register` and upload
   the license file.
8. Go to `${URL}/${ROOT}/sluzby/db-server/sparql` and execute all the queries in the `db-server/lucene` directory to
   create Lucene connectors for full-text search (see below w.r.t. the connector language settings).
10. (_Optional_, recommended) Go to Setup/Users and access and enable security. Create a new user that TermIt and other
    related services will use to access the `termit` repository. Give the new user write access to the `termit`
    repository. Set the new user's username and password as `GDB_USERNAME` a `GDB_PASSWORD` in `.env` so that all
    relevant applications can access the repository.
11. Go to `${URL}/${ROOT}/sluzby/auth` (http://localhost:1234/termit/sluzby/auth by default) and log into the Keycloak
    administration console using the `KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_USER` and `KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_PASSWORD` values. Switch to realm
    `termit` and register new users. Assign the new users roles (use one of `ROLE_ADMIN`, `ROLE_FULL_USER` or
    `ROLE_RESTRICTED_USER` for each user).
12. TermIt is now available at `${URL}/${ROOT}` (http://localhost:1234/termit by default), OntoGrapher at
    `${URL}/${ROOT}/ontographer` (http://localhost:1234/termit/ontographer by default).
    - Note that OntoGrapher requires that URI of the vocabulary/ies to be used is passed to it as query parameters in
      the URL. So the the URL would be, for
      example: http://localhost:1234/termit/ontographer/?vocabulary=http://onto.fel.cvut.cz/ontologies/termit

## Configuration

TermIt is highly configurable both in terms of the content and the way it runs. This section provides details on
the most important configuration options.

### Language

The default configuration assumes TermIt is run for Czech vocabularies. To use TermIt in other environments, the
following changes are needed:

#### TermIt

TermIt backend uses a default language to set the primary language for vocabularies. To configure it, set
the `TERMIT_PERSISTENCE_LANGUAGE` value in `docker-compose.yml` to the appropriate language tag (e.g., en, de).

### Further TermIt Configuration

As stated above, TermIt is highly configurable. [This table](./termit-config.md) lists the names of environment
variables that can be passed to TermIt backend either directly in `docker-compose.yml`, in
an [env_file](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v3/#env_file), or via command line.

The parameters are based on
the [Configuration](https://github.com/kbss-cvut/termit/blob/master/src/main/java/cz/cvut/kbss/termit/util/Configuration.java)
class in TermIt backend. If you need to further adjust the behavior of TermIt, consult this class.

### Host Proxy Configuration

TermIt uses Web sockets for asynchronous communication between the server and the clients. If the host system runs a web
proxy (most do),
this needs to be configured in the proxy.

#### Apache2

For the Apache HTTP server (default on Debian and other Linux systems) this can be done by enabling the
`mod_proxy_wstunnel` [module](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_proxy_wstunnel.html) and using the following
rewrite rule:

```apache2
# Proxy WebSocket connections to termit at port 1234
  RewriteCond %{HTTP:Upgrade} websocket [NC]
  RewriteCond %{HTTP:Connection} upgrade [NC]
  RewriteRule ^/termit?(.*) "ws://localhost:1234/termit/sluzby/server$1" [P,L]
```

#### Nginx

For nginx, this can be done by adding the following snippet, which initializes the `connection_upgrade` variable, to
the `http` section of the `nginx.conf` file:

```nginx
map $http_upgrade $connection_upgrade {
   default upgrade;
   ''      close;
}
```

```nginx
location /termit {
   proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
   proxy_set_header Connection $connection_upgrade;
   # Other proxy headers and proxy_pass
}
```

### Keycloak

When using Keycloak as an authentication service behind a proxy, it is necessary to:

- Set `KC_HOSTNAME_URL` and `KC_HOSTNAME_ADMIN_URL` to the public URL at which Keycloak will be accessible to the
  outside world (proxied)
- Set `KC_HOSTNAME_STRICT_BACKCHANNEL` and `KC_PROXY` so that other services can use it via its Docker service URL
- Set `SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_RESOURCESERVER_JWT_ISSUERURI` in TermIt (and db-server-proxy) to the **public URL** of
  TermIt. This URL is used to validate the authentication token
- Set `SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_RESOURCESERVER_JWT_JWKSETURI` in TermIt (and db-server-proxy) to the **Docker service URL
  ** of Keycloak. This URL is used by TermIt to access the authentication service itself
- Both `TermIt UI` and `OntoGrapher` use the **public URL** of Keycloak
- Keycloak is configured to automatically import the pre-configured `termit` realm
  And then adding the `Upgrade` and `Connection` headers to the request:
