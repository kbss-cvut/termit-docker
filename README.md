# TermIt Docker

TermIt Docker serves to spin off a TermIt deployment, consisting of:

- [GraphDB](https://www.ontotext.com/products/graphdb/) (database)
- [TermIt](https://github.com/kbss-cvut/termit) (backend)
- [Annotace](https://github.com/kbss-cvut/annotace)
- [TermIt UI](https://github.com/kbss-cvut/termit-ui) (frontend)
- [OntoGrapher](https://github.com/datagov-cz/ontoGrapher/tree/standalone) (standalone branch)
- [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/)

## Prerequisities
- Docker 23.0.1 or later & Docker Compose installed (and accessible under the current user).

### Resource Requirements

- TermIt: at least 512MB RAM (1GB and more is optimal), 1 CPU
- TermIt UI: 100MB RAM is more than enough
- GraphDB: at least 2GB RAM (depending on the amount of data stored), 1 CPU
- Annotace: at least 512MB RAM
- OntoGrapher: same as TermIt UI
- Keycloak + Postgres: (1CPU and approx. 512MB RAM)

Ideally, the whole deployment should have at least 4GB RAM available, with at least 2-3 CPU cores.

## Running TermIt

1. (_Optional_) Set `ROOT` variable in `.env` to reflect the local context prefix the app will be running on.
2. (_Optional_) Set `HOST_PORT` variable in `.env` to reflect the port on which TermIt should be accessible.
3. (_Optional_) Set `URL` variable in `.env` to reflect the address TermIt will be running on. If the system is running
   behind a server proxy (like Apache), the URL should be the **public URL** provided by the server proxy (for
   example, https://termit.fel.cvut.cz). Otherwise,
   the URL should contain the `HOST_PORT` specified above (for example, http://localhost:1234). If the **public URL**
   is not based on standards HTTP(S) ports (80, 443), set also the `PUBLIC_PORT` so that the backend is able to
   correctly generate server URL for the API docs using Swagger UI.
4. (_Optional_) Set `KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_USER` and `KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_PASSWORD` in `.env` to a custom value.
5. Start all the services by running
   `docker-compose up -d`
6. (_Optional_) If you have a license for GraphDB, go to `${URL}/${ROOT}/sluzby/db-server/license/register` and upload
   the license file.
7. Go to `${URL}/${ROOT}/sluzby/db-server/import#server`, select the "termit" repository, and in the "Server files"
   section, click the "Import" button for all the files. In the "Import settings" dialog, set the Base IRI
   to `http://onto.fel.cvut.cz/ontologies/termit`.
8. Go to `${URL}/${ROOT}/sluzby/db-server/sparql` and execute all the queries in the `db-server/lucene` directory to
   create Lucene connectors for full-text search (see below w.r.t. the connector language settings).
9. (_Optional_, recommended) Go to Setup/Users and access and enable security. Create a new user that TermIt and other related services will use to access the `termit` repository. Give the new user write access to the `termit` repository. Set the new user's username and password as `GDB_USERNAME` a `GDB_PASSWORD` in `.env` so that all relevant applications can access the repository.
10. Go to `${URL}/${ROOT}/sluzby/auth` (http://localhost:1234/termit/sluzby/auth by default) and log into the Keycloak administration console using the `KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_USER` and `KEYCLOAK_ADMIN_PASSWORD` values. Switch to realm `termit` and register new users. Assign the new users roles (use one of `ROLE_ADMIN`, `ROLE_FULL_USER` or `ROLE_RESTRICTED_USER` for each user).
11. TermIt is now available at `${URL}/${ROOT}` (http://localhost:1234/termit by default), OntoGrapher at `${URL}/${ROOT}/ontographer` (http://localhost:1234/termit/ontographer by default).
    - Note that OntoGrapher requires that URI of the vocabulary/ies to be used is passed to it as query parameters in the URL. So the the URL would be, for example: http://localhost:1234/termit/ontographer/?vocabulary=http://onto.fel.cvut.cz/ontologies/termit

## Configuration

TermIt is highly configurable both in terms of the content and the way it runs. This section provides details on
the most important configuration options.

### Language

The default configuration assumes TermIt is run for Czech vocabularies. To use TermIt in other environments, the
following changes are needed:

#### TermIt

TermIt backend stores and loads strings based on the configured language. To change it, set
the `TERMIT_PERSISTENCE_LANGUAGE` value in `docker-compose.yml` to the appropriate language tag (e.g., en, de).

#### Full Text Search

Full text search (FTS) is implemented via Lucene connectors in the underlying GraphDB repository. These connectors are
language-specific, so to use a different language for TermIt and FTS working correctly, the Lucene connectors need to be
configured accordingly. To use a different language that Czech, set the following in the connector-creating SPARQL
queries in `db-server/lucene`:

- Set the value of the "languages" attribute to the appropriate language tag
- Set the value of the "analyzer" attribute to the appropriate fully qualified Lucene analyzer class name. See, for
  example, https://lucene.apache.org/core/4_0_0/analyzers-common/overview-summary.html.

### Further TermIt Configuration

As stated above, TermIt is highly configurable. The following table lists the names of environment variables that can be
passed to TermIt backend either directly in `docker-compose.yml`, in
an [env_file](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v3/#env_file), or via command line.

**\* Required**

### OntoGrapher

OntoGrapher is configured to use the same authentication service (Keycloak) as TermIt. It is also configured with adresses of other relevant services via the `ONTOGRAPHER_COMPONENTS` variable. If any changes are made to the paths/URLs of these services, it is necessary to update the `ONTOGRAPHER_COMPONENTS` value accordingly and rebuild the OntoGrapher image. The `ONTOGRAPHER_COMPONENTS` is a base 64-encoded JSON string, so it is necessary to decode it, make changes, and then encode it again.

### Keycloak

When using Keycloak as an authentication service behind a proxy, it is necessary to:
- Set `KC_HOSTNAME_URL` and `KC_HOSTNAME_ADMIN_URL` to the public URL at which Keycloak will be accessible to the outside world (proxied)
- Set `KC_HOSTNAME_STRICT_BACKCHANNEL` and `KC_PROXY` so that other services can use it via its Docker service URL
- Set `SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_RESOURCESERVER_JWT_ISSUERURI` in TermIt (and db-server-proxy) to the **public URL** of TermIt. This URL is used to validate the authentication token
- Set `SPRING_SECURITY_OAUTH2_RESOURCESERVER_JWT_JWKSETURI` in TermIt (and db-server-proxy) to the **Docker service URL** of Keycloak. This URL is used by TermIt to access the authentication service itself
- Both `TermIt UI` and `OntoGrapher` use the **public URL** of Keycloak
- Keycloak is configured to automatically import the pre-configured `termit` realm
